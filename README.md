# Node.js Redis client
Simple Redis Node.js client (not production ready) WITHOUT any npm dependencies.

It's using Node.js core modules:
- `net`
- `tls`

This client is not perfect and can be not stable. I created it for learning how Redis works.
### Better production-ready Node.js clients:
- `ioredis` (https://github.com/luin/ioredis)
- `node-redis` (https://github.com/NodeRedis/node-redis)
